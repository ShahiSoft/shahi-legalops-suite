## 📞 QUESTIONS & CLARIFICATION

### Common Questions

**Q: Why 12+ documents instead of focusing on the top 3?**  
A: Market gap analysis shows competitors' weakness is document variety. 12 types = broader addressable market (eCommerce, SaaS, B2B services, healthcare, etc.)

**Q: Can we launch with just Privacy Policy, Terms, and Cookies?**  
A: Yes! MVP = these 3 documents. Additional 9 documents rolled out in Phase 4 (post-MVP).

**Q: How does this integrate with existing ShahiComplyFlow modules?**  
A: Full integration points documented in TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md - links to Consent Manager, Accessibility Scanner, DSR Portal, etc.

**Q: What about AI content generation - is this vaporware?**  
A: Documented as Phase 4 enhancement (post-MVP). MVP uses intelligent templates + conditional logic. AI phase uses actual LLM integration (GPT-4, etc.).

**Q: Why the specific pricing of $59?**  
A: Detailed analysis in COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md shows $59 for all-in-one is 3.5x better value than $120+ specialist tools.

**Q: How do we handle regulatory updates (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)?**  
A: Documented as Phase 4 feature - real-time monitoring system with auto-alerts and suggested updates.
