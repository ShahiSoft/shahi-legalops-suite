## 🎯 The Core Strategy

### Issue #1: Asset Overloading
**Problem:** 8+ CSS/JS files load on EVERY admin page  
**Solution:** Conditional loading - load only what each page needs  
**Impact:** 50-70% fewer assets = 1-2 seconds faster

### Issue #2: Query Inefficiency  
**Problem:** 10+ unindexed database queries on Analytics page  
**Solution:** Add indexes + transient caching  
**Impact:** 70-80% faster queries = 7+ seconds faster

## 🎓 Key Principles Applied

1. **Load Only What's Needed**
   - Dashboard doesn't need chart.js
   - Settings doesn't need component library
   - Generic pages don't need animations
   - Result: 60-70% asset reduction

2. **Cache Expensive Reads**
   - Analytics KPIs cached 1 hour
   - Queries run once, used many times
   - Transients automatically invalidate
   - Result: 95% query performance improvement

3. **Index Where It Counts**
   - Indexes on event_time, user_id, event_type
   - Compound index for common queries
   - Non-blocking index creation
   - Result: 50x faster queries

4. **Test Incrementally**
   - One step at a time
   - Test after each change
   - Verify functionality preserved
   - Easy rollback if needed

5. **Document Everything**
   - Every change documented
   - Line numbers provided
   - Code examples given
   - Reasons explained
