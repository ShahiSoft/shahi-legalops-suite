    <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
    
    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, {{company_legal_name}}) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
    
    <h3>Types of Cookies by Duration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These cookies are temporary and expire once you close your browser (or once your session ends).</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These cookies remain on your device for a set period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time you visit the website that created that particular cookie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Why We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.

Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our website or opened an email including them.</p>
    
    <p>This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.</p>
    
    <p>In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies may impair their functionality.</p>
