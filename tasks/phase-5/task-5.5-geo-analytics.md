# TASK 5.5: Geographic Analytics

Phase: 5 | Effort: 6-8h | Next: 5.6

Geo breakdown of consents/DSR/doc acceptance.
- Use geo table from geolocation; aggregate by country/region + regulation (GDPR/CCPA/LGPD/UK-GDPR/PIPEDA/POPIA).
- Choropleth map component; drill-down list; show template variant mix by region.
- Export CSV/PDF; include consented vs non-consented segments.

Success: map renders; aggregates match DB; regulation filters work.
