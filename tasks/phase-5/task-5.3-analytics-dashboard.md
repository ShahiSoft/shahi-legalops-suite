# TASK 5.3: Analytics Dashboard UI

Phase: 5 | Effort: 8-10h | Next: 5.4

Admin dashboard for metrics (consent-aware, regulation-aware).
- Widgets: KPIs (consent rate, withdrawals, DSR open/closed, SLA compliance %), charts (line/area), top purposes, geography map, device/browser pie, compliance score.
- Filters: date range, regulation (GDPR/CCPA/LGPD/UK-GDPR), locale, template variant, device.
- Export PNG/CSV/PDF of charts; scheduled email exports.
- Performance: dashboard loads <1.5s with cached/pre-aggregated data (1M rows target); show cache age indicator.

Success: dashboard loads within budget and exports available with applied filters.
