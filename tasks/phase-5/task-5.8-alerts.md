# TASK 5.8: Alerts & Thresholds

Phase: 5 | Effort: 4-6h | Next: 5.9

Set alerts on key metrics.
- Configurable thresholds (drop in consent rate, spike in withdrawals, SLA breach count, compliance score) per regulation (GDPR/CCPA/LGPD/UK-GDPR/PIPEDA/POPIA) and consent state.
- Delivery: email/Slack webhook; quiet hours and rate limiting to avoid spam.

Success: alert triggers when threshold crossed; notification sent; regulation/consent filters applied.
