# TASK 5.7: Withdrawal & Trend Analysis

Phase: 5 | Effort: 6-8h | Next: 5.8

Analyze withdrawals and consent trends.
- Time-series of withdrawals; correlation with banner template changes and regulation (GDPR/CCPA/LGPD/UK-GDPR/PIPEDA/POPIA).
- Funnel from view -> accept/reject -> later withdraw; segment by consent state and template variant.
- Cohort analysis by country/device/regulation; include consented vs non-consented users.

Success: charts produced; actionable insights documented; regulation/template filters work.
