Phase: 6 | Effort: 6-8h | Next: 6.7

Audit and fix accessibility.
- Cover banner, preferences, DSR portal, legal docs, analytics dashboards, admin settings. Ensure ARIA labels, focus states, contrast, keyboard navigation, skip links, focus order, reduced-motion respect, error messaging.
- Run automated axe-core/pa11y; manual WCAG 2.1 AA + note AAA gaps; test RTL and screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver).

Success: WCAG AA pass recorded; AAA gaps documented; automated scans clean; critical flows keyboard- and SR-friendly.
