# TASK 6.5: White-label & Theming

Phase: 6 | Effort: 4-6h | Next: 6.6

Allow branding removal and custom themes.
- Toggle to hide plugin branding across admin widgets, banners, emails, analytics; per-tenant setting.
- Theme presets; export/import theme settings (JSON) with validation. Custom CSS/JS injection (sanitized) with CSP-safe guidance.
- Ensure white-label applies to PDFs/emails/embeds as well.

Success: white-label mode hides branding everywhere; presets load; export/import works; custom assets sanitized.
