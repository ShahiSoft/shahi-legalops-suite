# TASK 6.7: Migration & Import Tools

Phase: 6 | Effort: 6-8h | Next: 6.8

Import from other consent/DSR plugins.
- CSV/JSON import mappers for major vendors (IAB TCF exports, OneTrust, Cookiebot, TrustArc); map purposes, vendors, logs to internal schema; geolocation/regulation aware.
- Conflict detection, deduping, and dry-run report (records created/updated/skipped) with rollback option.

Success: migration wizard dry-run and apply complete with summary; mappings correct; rollback available on failure.
