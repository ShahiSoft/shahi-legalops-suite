# TASK 6.4: A/B Testing for Banner Variants

Phase: 6 | Effort: 6-8h | Next: 6.5

Experiment with banner templates/colors/text.
- Define experiments with variants; random assignment with regulation-aware bucketing (GDPR/CCPA/etc.) and consent-state stratification; respect geolocation/template rules.
- Metrics: consent rate, withdrawal rate, time-to-consent, bounce; minimum sample size and guardrails; auto-stop on significance or negative impact; holdout group.
- Dashboard showing lift by regulation/locale/template; export results; allow manual winner selection with audit log.

Success: experiment stats computed with guardrails; lift visible by regulation/locale; winner can be set; holdout respected.
