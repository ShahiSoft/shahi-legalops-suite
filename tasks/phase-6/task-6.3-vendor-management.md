# TASK 6.3: Vendor Management

Phase: 6 | Effort: 6-8h | Next: 6.4

Manage third-party vendors/processors.
- Table of vendors with data categories, purposes, DPAs/SCCs/TIAs, regions, subprocessors, retention, lawful basis, risk score.
- Link consents and documents to vendors; map purposes to IAB TCF categories where applicable; per-regulation obligations (GDPR/CCPA/etc.).
- UI to mark risky vendors, renewal dates/SLAs; reminders and export (CSV/PDF) including risk notes and contracts.

Success: vendors stored with full metadata; consents mapped to vendors; exports include risk/contract info; reminders visible for upcoming renewals.
